# Enhanced Validation in AG-UI Nim SDK

This PR adds comprehensive validation improvements to the AG-UI Nim SDK, with a focus on complex object types, better error reporting, and enhanced type safety.

## What's Changed

1. **ValidationError Improvements**
   - Added `ValidationErrorKind` enum for error categorization
   - Enhanced error messages with detailed path information
   - Added expected vs. actual type information for better debugging

2. **New Validation Functions**
   - Added `validateJsonSchema` for JSON Schema validation
   - Added `validateJsonPatch` for RFC 6902 JSON Patch operations
   - Added `validateFunctionCallParameters` for tool parameters
   - Added `validateObjectKeys` to ensure required fields are present
   - Added `validateArrayMinLength` for arrays with minimum size

3. **Optional Field Handling**
   - Improved validation for optional fields with proper null checks
   - Added helpers for optional types (string, int, int64, bool)
   - Better handling of missing fields vs. null fields

4. **Complex Object Validation**
   - Enhanced validation for nested structures like tool parameters
   - Added proper JSON Schema validation for tool definitions
   - Added RFC 6902 compliant validation for JSON Patch operations
   - Improved function call argument validation to check JSON syntax

5. **Testing**
   - Added a dedicated test suite for complex validation (test_complex_validation.nim)
   - Tests for each complex type validation function
   - Tests for error handling and edge cases

## Technical Details

- All validation functions now provide more meaningful error messages with exact path information
- The validateEvent function has been enhanced to handle all 16 standard event types
- JSON Patch operations are now validated according to the RFC 6902 specification
- All core tests pass successfully with the enhanced validation

## What's Next

With these validation improvements, the SDK is now more robust and provides better developer feedback. The next steps are:

1. Complete integration of the remaining features
2. Add more test cases for edge conditions
3. Improve documentation with examples of the validation system

This PR completes all four immediate priorities from the TODO.md file, bringing the SDK closer to production readiness.
