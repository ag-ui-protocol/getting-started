# AG-UI Nim SDK Implementation Progress

## What We've Accomplished

We've made significant progress implementing the AG-UI (Agent-User Interaction Protocol) in Nim:

1. **Core Types and Events**
   - Implemented all standard AG-UI message types (Developer, System, Assistant, User, Tool)
   - Added all 16 standard event types including chunk events
   - Added serialization and deserialization for all types
   - All core types tests pass successfully

2. **Event Encoder**
   - Implemented `EventEncoder` for SSE encoding
   - Added support for content type negotiation
   - Added support for chunked events
   - All encoder tests pass successfully

3. **Agent Implementation**
   - Implemented `AbstractAgent` base class
   - Created HTTP agent with SSE support
   - Added authentication and request customization
   - All agent tests pass successfully

4. **Stream Utilities**
   - Fixed import paths in stream utilities
   - Implemented `AgentState` type and `ApplyEvents` function
   - Added `structuredClone` for deep copying objects
   - Added JSON patch operations for state deltas

5. **Validation Improvements**
   - Resolved type mismatches in validation functions
   - Added support for all event types in validation
   - Improved handling of optional fields
   - Added proper validation for chunk events

## What's Next

The following areas still need attention:

1. **Validation for Complex Objects**
   - Enhanced validation for nested object structures
   - Better error messages for validation failures
   - Additional validation for edge cases

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Memory usage improvements for large event streams
   - Optimize encoding/decoding for large payloads

3. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Complete integration tests for all features
   - Add more test cases for error conditions
   - Generate API documentation
   - Add code examples for common use cases

4. **Transport Extensions**
   - Add WebSocket transport implementation
   - Add Webhook transport support

## Current Status

- Core types and events: ✅ Working
- Encoder functionality: ✅ Working
- Agent implementation: ✅ Working
- Stream utilities: ✅ Working
- Event validation: ✅ Working
- Protocol Buffer support: ⚠️ Implementation complete, tests need fixing
- Legacy Format support: ⚠️ Implementation complete, tests need fixing
- Observable pattern: ⚠️ Implementation complete, tests need fixing

All core functionality is working as expected, with only advanced features needing additional testing and integration.
