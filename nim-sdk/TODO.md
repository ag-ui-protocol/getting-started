# AG-UI Nim SDK Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

We have implemented all the core features needed for AG-UI compatibility with basic tests passing successfully:

### 1. Core Types and Events
- [x] Implemented all standard AG-UI message types (Developer, System, Assistant, User, Tool)
- [x] Added all 16 standard event types including chunk events
- [x] Added serialization and deserialization for all types
- [x] All core types tests pass successfully

### 2. Event Encoder
- [x] Implemented `EventEncoder` for SSE encoding
- [x] Added support for content type negotiation
- [x] Added support for chunked events
- [x] All encoder tests pass successfully

### 3. Agent Implementation
- [x] Implemented `AbstractAgent` base class
- [x] Created HTTP agent with SSE support
- [x] Added authentication and request customization
- [x] All agent tests pass successfully

### 4. Additional Features (Partially Integrated)
The following features have been implemented but need fixes for test integration:

- [x] **Stream Utilities**: `AgentState` type and `ApplyEvents` function
- [x] **Event Verification**: For validating event sequences and lifecycle
- [x] **Event Application**: To transform events into agent state
- [x] **Chunk Transformations**: For converting chunk events to regular events
- [x] **SSE Stream Parsing**: For Server-Sent Events
- [x] **Schema Validation**: For runtime type checking
- [x] **Observable Pattern**: For event streaming (RxJS-like)
- [x] **Protocol Buffer Support**: For binary encoding/decoding
- [x] **Legacy Format Support**: For backward compatibility

## üî¥ Integration Issues

Some integration issues need to be resolved:

1. **Path Imports**: Some modules need import path fixes
2. **Type Mismatches**: Between event types and validation functions
3. **Test Dependencies**: Tests need to be updated to work with new features
4. **Error Handling**: Better error management for complex validations

## üîÑ Next Steps

To complete the implementation, focus on:

### Immediate Priorities
1. ‚úÖ Fix import paths in stream utilities
2. ‚úÖ Resolve type mismatches in validation functions
3. ‚úÖ Update tests to work with new chunk events
4. ‚úÖ Fix validation for complex object types

### Short-Term Tasks
1. ‚úÖ Complete integration of stream functionality
2. ‚úÖ Integrate event verification functionality
3. Continue integrating more advanced features (transform, observable, proto, legacy)
4. Add more test cases for new functionality
5. Improve error handling throughout the codebase
6. Update documentation with new feature examples

### Long-Term Enhancements
1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Improve memory usage
   - Optimize encoding/decoding for large payloads

2. **Additional Transport Implementations**
   - WebSocket transport
   - Webhook transport

3. **Enhanced Documentation**
   - Generate API documentation from code
   - Create migration guides from other SDKs

4. **Advanced Error Handling**
   - Add more custom error types
   - Implement retry mechanisms

5. **Testing and Integration**
   - Add end-to-end tests
   - Add benchmarks for performance comparison
