AG-UI is an open, lightweight, event-based protocol that standardizes **how AI agents connect to front-end applications**.

- Just like MCP standardizes Agent-to-Tool interaction...
- A2A by Google standardizes Agent-to-Agent interaction...
- AG-UI standardizes Agent to User interaction.

## AG-UI Specification

AG-UI is an open, lightweight, event-based protocol for agent-human interaction, designed simplicity & flexibility:
* During agent executions, agent backends **emit events _compatible_ with one of AG-UI's 16 standard event types**
* Agent backends can **accept one of a few simple AG-UI compatible inputs** as arguments

**AG-UI includes a flexible middleware layer** that ensures compatibility across diverse environments:
- Works with **any event transport** (SSE, WebSockets, webhooks, etc.)
- Allows for **loose event format matching**, enabling broad agent and app interoperability  

It also ships with a **reference HTTP implementation** and **default connector** to help teams get started fast.

## Why AG-UI?
AG-UI was developed based on real-world requirements and practical experience building in-app agent interactions.

It was shaped through:
- Working with users in the CopilotKit community to understand the needs of agent-based interactions in applications
- Collaborating closely with leading agent frameworks (LangGraph, Mastra, CrewAI, AG2, etc.)
- Extracting common infrastructure patterns that emerged across varied frameworks into a standardized, open protocol

This practical approach has helped ensure that AG-UI is both flexible and immediately applicable in real-world use cases.
